# Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to my **Learning Projects Repository**! This repo is a collection of small projects, coding exercises, and mini-apps I'm working on to improve my skills and explore new languages, frameworks, and concepts.

## üìö What's Inside
- **Python**: Basic algorithms, scripts, and small projects.
- **JavaScript**: Mini web projects, DOM manipulation, and basic algorithms.
- **HTML & CSS**: Basic web layouts, styling, and practice with responsive design.

Each directory includes code and descriptions to outline what I‚Äôm learning and any challenges or concepts I explored.

## üöÄ Project Goals
- **Learn**: To deepen my understanding of programming languages and concepts.
- **Practice**: Build small projects to apply knowledge in a practical way.
- **Document**: Keep a record of my progress and reflections for future reference.

## üîç Current Focus
Right now, I'm focusing on:
- Strengthening my Python programming with algorithm practice.
- Learning JavaScript basics by creating interactive elements for web pages.
- Exploring front-end design with HTML and CSS by creating a simple personal website.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Resources
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Resources**: Online courses, coding challenges, and tutorials

Feel free to check out my projects and see my learning journey. Suggestions and feedback are always welcome!
